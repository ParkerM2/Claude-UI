# QA Scenario: Task Creation Flow

## Objective

Verify that users can create tasks through the task dashboard UI with proper validation, feedback, and error handling.

## Preconditions

- Application is running (`npm run dev`)
- MCP Electron server is accessible (port 9222)
- At least one project exists in the project list
- User is on the task dashboard view (or can navigate to it)

## Setup Steps

1. Use `get_electron_window_info` to verify app is running
2. Take baseline screenshot
3. If not on task dashboard, navigate there via sidebar

## Cleanup Steps

After completing all test cases:

2. Document cleanup procedure if needed
3. Take final screenshot of board state

---

## Accessibility Checklist

- [ ] All form inputs have visible labels or aria-labels
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible on all interactive elements
- [ ] Error messages are programmatically associated with inputs
- [ ] Modal can be closed with Escape key
- [ ] Submit button is keyboard accessible
- [ ] Color is not the only indicator of required fields
- [ ] Error messages use appropriate contrast

## Console Log Patterns to Watch For

**Errors** (test fails if present):
- `TypeError: Cannot read property`
- `Unhandled promise rejection`
- `Failed to create task`
- `Network error`

**Warnings** (note but may not fail):
- `React key warning`
- `Deprecation warning`
- `Missing prop type`
