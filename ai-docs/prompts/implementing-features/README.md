## 1. Lifecycle Overview

Every feature passes through these phases. No phase may be skipped.

     Update tracker.json: add entry with status DRAFT or APPROVED
```

### TEST GATE — NON-NEGOTIABLE

**At EVERY transition, the test suite MUST pass:**

```bash
# These 5 commands MUST pass before ANY completion claim
npm run lint         # Zero violations
npm run typecheck    # Zero errors
npm run test         # All tests pass
npm run build        # Builds successfully
npm run check:docs   # Documentation updated for source changes
```

**Skipping tests or doc updates = automatic failure. No exceptions. No excuses.**

### Tracker Update — Team Lead Responsibility

The Team Lead MUST update `docs/tracker.json` at each lifecycle transition:

| Transition | Tracker Update |
|------------|---------------|
| Feature planned | Add entry with status `DRAFT` or `APPROVED` |
| Work begins | Set status to `IN_PROGRESS`, set `branch` field |
| Work blocked | Set status to `BLOCKED` |
| Implementation complete | Set status to `IMPLEMENTED` |
| Feature superseded | Set status to `SUPERSEDED`, set `supersededBy` field |
| Feature archived | Move files to `doc-history/`, update paths, set status to `ARCHIVED` |

Always update `statusChangedAt` when changing status. Run `npm run validate:tracker` to verify.

---

## 2. Progress Tracking (Crash-Safe)

### Why This Exists

Claude Code sessions can terminate unexpectedly (terminal close, timeout, process kill). The progress file is a **crash-recovery artifact** — when a new session picks up the work, it reads this file to understand exactly where things left off.

### The Progress File

**Location**: `docs/progress/<feature-name>-progress.md`

The Team Lead MUST create this file BEFORE spawning any agents, and update it after EVERY significant state change (agent complete, agent failed, phase transition).

**When to update the progress file:**
- After creating the team and tasks
- After each agent is spawned (record worktree branch)
- After each agent completes or fails
- After each QA cycle (pass/fail)
- After integration (merge, commit)
- After documentation updates

**What goes in the progress file:**

```markdown
# Feature: <Feature Name>
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS | BLOCKED | QA_REVIEW | INTEGRATING | COMPLETE
**Team**: <team-name>
**Branch**: feature/<feature-name>
**Design Doc**: docs/plans/<design-doc>.md
**Started**: <ISO timestamp>
**Last Updated**: <ISO timestamp>

## Agent Registry
| Agent Name | Role | Worktree Branch | Task ID | Status | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------------|---------|--------|-------|
| schema-designer | Schema Designer | feature/<name>/schema | #1 | COMPLETE | Types + IPC done |
| service-eng | Service Engineer | feature/<name>/service | #2 | IN_PROGRESS | Working on auth handler |
| component-eng | Component Engineer | feature/<name>/ui | #3 | PENDING | Blocked by #2 |
| qa-review-svc | QA Reviewer | feature/<name>/service | - | PENDING | Will review #2 output |

## Task Progress
### Task #1: Define types and IPC contract [COMPLETE]
- Agent: schema-designer
- Files created: src/shared/types/foo.ts, src/shared/ipc-contract.ts (modified)
- QA: PASSED (report: <link or inline>)
- Merged to: feature/<feature-name>

### Task #2: Implement foo service [IN_PROGRESS]
- Agent: service-eng
- Files: src/main/services/foo/foo-service.ts (creating)
- Step 1/4: Service factory ✅
- Step 2/4: CRUD methods ✅
- Step 3/4: IPC handlers 🔄 (in progress)
- Step 4/4: Event emissions ⬜

### Task #3: Build FooPage component [PENDING]
- Blocked by: Task #2 (needs IPC handlers to exist)

## Blockers
- None currently

## QA Results
### Round 1 — Task #1 (schema-designer)
- Automated: lint ✅ typecheck ✅ build ✅
- Manual: All checks pass
- Verdict: APPROVED

## Recovery Notes
If resuming from crash:
1. Read this file for current state
2. Check `git worktree list` for active worktrees
3. Check TaskList for team task status
4. Resume from the first non-COMPLETE task
```

### Tracker.json Integration

The Team Lead must update `docs/tracker.json` at these lifecycle points:
- **New feature**: Add entry with status `IN_PROGRESS`
- **Feature complete**: Set status to `IMPLEMENTED`
- **Feature archived**: Move files to `doc-history/`, update paths, set status to `ARCHIVED`
- **Feature superseded**: Set status to `SUPERSEDED`, set `supersededBy` field

Run `npm run validate:tracker` to verify tracker integrity after any changes.

### Recovery Protocol (For New Sessions)

When a Team Lead agent starts and detects existing progress:

1. Read `docs/progress/<feature-name>-progress.md`
2. Run `git worktree list` to verify worktree state
3. Check if the team still exists (read `~/.claude/teams/<team-name>/config.json`)
4. If team exists: use `TaskList` to get current state, resume from first pending task
5. If team doesn't exist: recreate team, create remaining tasks, spawn agents for pending work
6. Update progress file with recovery timestamp

---

## 3. Documentation Maintenance

### The Rule

> Documentation updates are part of the same work, not a trailing step. Each coding agent updates docs for their own changes. `npm run check:docs` enforces this.

### Which Docs to Update

| Document | Location | Update When |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ai-docs/FEATURES-INDEX.md` | Feature/service/component inventory | New feature module, new service, new shared component/hook/store |
| `ai-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | System diagram, service list, IPC flow | New service, new IPC channel, new feature module, architectural change |
| `ai-docs/PATTERNS.md` | Code patterns and conventions | New pattern established, existing pattern modified |
| `ai-docs/DATA-FLOW.md` | Data flow diagrams | New data path, new event, new store, new IPC channel |
| `ai-docs/LINTING.md` | ESLint rules and fix patterns | New eslint-disable justification, new rule exception |
| `ai-docs/user-interface-flow.md` | UX flow map, component wiring | New user-facing feature, UI layout change, gap resolution |
| `ai-docs/CODEBASE-GUARDIAN.md` | File placement and naming rules | New directory, new structural pattern |
| `CLAUDE.md` | AI agent guidelines | New path alias, new tech stack entry, new convention |
| `PROGRESS.md` | Build progress tracker | Feature completed or milestone reached |

### How Documentation Updates Work

Each coding agent is responsible for updating docs alongside their own code changes. The Team Lead verifies completeness:

1. Each coding agent updates relevant docs as part of their task (not after)
2. `npm run check:docs` runs as part of the 5-command verification gate
3. If any coding agent missed doc updates, the check fails and they must fix it
4. After all tasks + QA pass, the Team Lead runs a final `npm run check:docs` to verify
5. If gaps remain, the Team Lead can spawn a documentation verification agent to catch misses

```

### Updating the Structure

When a feature adds new directories or files to the structure:

1. The documentation agent adds the new paths to `ai-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` structure section
2. If a new feature module is created, add it to the features list with a brief description
3. If a new service is created, add it to the service list in ARCHITECTURE.md
4. If new IPC channels are added, add them to DATA-FLOW.md channel table
5. The Team Lead verifies the structure section matches `reality` (run `ls` commands to confirm)

---

## 4. Agent Teams Setup

### Creating the Team

```
TeamCreate:
  team_name: "<feature-name>"
  description: "Implementing <feature description>"
```

### Creating Tasks with Dependencies

Tasks MUST be created with proper `blockedBy` relationships to prevent agents from starting work before prerequisites are ready.

**Standard dependency chain:**

```
Task #1: Schema/Types (no blockers)              ← Schema Designer
Task #2: Service implementation (blocked by #1)   ← Service Engineer
Task #3: IPC handlers (blocked by #2)             ← IPC Handler Engineer
Task #4: Zustand store (blocked by #1)            ← Store Engineer
Task #5: React Query hooks (blocked by #3, #4)    ← Hook Engineer
Task #6: Components (blocked by #5)               ← Component Engineer
Task #7: Router/navigation (blocked by #6)        ← Router Engineer
Task #8: Documentation update (blocked by all)    ← Codebase Guardian
```

Parallel-safe tasks (can run simultaneously):
- Schema (#1) + Database (#2 if Hub changes needed)
- Store (#4) + Service (#2) (different files, both depend on schema)
- Components (#6) + Styling (#6b) (if separate agents)

### Worktree Strategy

Each agent SHOULD work in its own git worktree to prevent file conflicts:

```bash
# Team Lead creates worktrees before spawning agents
git worktree add ../claude-ui-schema feature/<name>/schema
git worktree add ../claude-ui-service feature/<name>/service
git worktree add ../claude-ui-ui feature/<name>/ui
```

**Exception**: If the feature is small (< 5 files), agents can share the main worktree with strict file-scope rules (no two agents edit the same file).

Record each agent's worktree in the progress file.

---

## 5. Agent Initialization Protocol

### Mandatory Initialization for EVERY Agent

When spawning any agent via the `Task` tool, the prompt MUST include:

```
## Initialization (MANDATORY — do these BEFORE any code)

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` — project rules (DO NOT SKIP)
2. Read `ai-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — system architecture
3. Read `ai-docs/PATTERNS.md` — code conventions
4. Read `ai-docs/LINTING.md` — ESLint rules and fix patterns

## Required Skills (USE THESE — they are NOT optional)

You MUST invoke the superpowers skills system. Before ANY action, use the appropriate skill:

- Before designing/planning: invoke `superpowers:brainstorming`
- Before writing code: invoke `superpowers:writing-plans` (plan first, code second)
- While coding: invoke `superpowers:test-driven-development` if tests exist
- When hitting bugs: invoke `superpowers:systematic-debugging`
- Before claiming done: invoke `superpowers:verification-before-completion`
- For code review: invoke `superpowers:requesting-code-review`

The skills enforce disciplined thinking. Skipping them leads to sloppy code that fails QA.

## Your Agent Definition

Read your agent prompt at `.claude/agents/<your-role>.md` for your specific:
- File scope (what you can and cannot touch)
- Code templates and patterns
- Self-review checklist
- Handoff protocol
```

### Providing Task Context

Every agent spawn MUST include:

```
## Task
<clear description of what to build/modify>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] <specific, testable criterion>
- [ ] <specific, testable criterion>
- [ ] tsc --noEmit passes clean
- [ ] npm run lint passes clean

## Files to Create
- <exact path>

## Files to Modify
- <exact path> (describe what changes)

## Files to Read for Context
- <paths to existing code the agent needs to understand>

## Dependencies
- Blocked by: Task #X (<what must exist before this agent starts>)
- Blocks: Task #Y (<what depends on this agent's output>)

## QA Checklist
<include the filled-out QA-CHECKLIST-TEMPLATE.md — see section 6>
```

## 6. QA Verification Workflow

### The Flow

```
Coding Agent                    QA Review Agent

     │                                ├─ checks documentation additions
     │                                ├─ analyzes data flow + error paths
     │                                ├─ checks for performance/DRY/scalability issues
     │                                ├─ starts Electron app (npm run dev)
     │                                ├─ uses MCP electron tools to test UI
     │                                │   ├─ get_electron_window_info (verify app runs)
     │                                │   ├─ take_screenshot (visual verification)

     │                                │
     ├─ if FAIL:                      │
     │   ├─ fix issues                │
     │   ├─ RUN TEST SUITE AGAIN      │
     │   ├─ spawn NEW QA agent ──────▶│  (repeat, max 3 rounds)
     │                                │

     │   │   task completion message   │
     │   ├─ notify Team Lead ─────────┘
     │
     └─ Team Lead marks task complete
```

### TEST SUITE IS MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS

**Both the coding agent AND the QA agent must independently run the full test suite.**

If either agent skips tests, the work is REJECTED.

```bash
# The test gate that must pass:
npm run lint         # Zero violations
npm run typecheck    # Zero errors
npm run test         # All unit + integration tests pass
npm run build        # Builds successfully
npm run check:docs   # Documentation updated for source changes
```

### Spawning the QA Review Agent (Coding Agent's Responsibility)

When a coding agent finishes its work, it MUST spawn a QA Review agent:

```
Task tool call:
  description: "QA review for Task #X"
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  team_name: <current team>
  name: "qa-review-task-X"
  mode: bypassPermissions
  prompt: |
    You are a QA Review Agent. Your job is to validate the work done for Task #X.

    ## Initialization
    1. Read `CLAUDE.md`
    2. Read `ai-docs/LINTING.md`
    3. Read `ai-docs/PATTERNS.md`
    4. Read `.claude/agents/qa-reviewer.md`
    5. Read `ai-docs/prompts/mcp_tools/electron_validation.md`

    ## Required Skills
    - invoke `superpowers:verification-before-completion` FIRST
    - invoke `superpowers:systematic-debugging` if issues found

    ## Task Context
    <paste the original task description and acceptance criteria>

    ## Files Changed
    <list all files the coding agent created/modified>

    ## QA Checklist
    <paste the filled QA checklist — see QA-CHECKLIST-TEMPLATE.md>

    ## Your Review Protocol

    ### Phase 1: Automated Checks
    Run these commands and record output:
    ```
    npm run lint
    npx tsc --noEmit
    npm run build
    ```
    If ANY fail, report FAIL immediately with exact error output.

    ### Phase 2: Code Review
    For every changed file:
    - Read the full file (not just the diff)
    - Check against CLAUDE.md patterns
    - Check for: unused imports, any types, hardcoded colors, missing a11y,
      floating promises, incorrect import order, missing error handling
    - Check data flow: does the IPC channel exist? Does the handler call a real service?
    - Check for performance: unnecessary re-renders, missing memoization on expensive ops
    - Check for DRYness: duplicated logic that should be extracted
    - Check for scalability: hardcoded limits, missing pagination, unbounded arrays

    ### Phase 3: Documentation Check
    - Were new files added? If yes, do barrel exports (index.ts) include them?
    - Were new IPC channels added? Are they in ipc-contract.ts?
    - Were new types added? Are they exported from the types barrel?

    ### Phase 4: Electron App Testing (MANDATORY for UI changes)
    1. Start the app: run `npm run dev` in background
    2. Wait for app to start (check logs for "ready" or similar)
    3. Use MCP electron tools:
       a. `mcp__electron__get_electron_window_info` — verify app is running
       b. `mcp__electron__take_screenshot` — visual state capture
       c. `mcp__electron__send_command_to_electron` with `get_page_structure`
       d. Navigate to the relevant page (click sidebar items)
       e. Test the specific feature: click buttons, fill forms, verify responses
       f. `mcp__electron__read_electron_logs` — check for console errors
    4. At minimum: navigate through ALL main app pages as a user would.
       Report any errors, blank pages, or broken navigation.

    ### Phase 5: QA Report
    Send your report back to the coding agent that spawned you.

    Format:
    ```
    QA REPORT: PASS | FAIL
    ═══════════════════════════════════
    Task: #X — <task name>
    Reviewed: <N> files

    Automated Checks:
      - lint: <PASS/FAIL> (<N> violations)
      - typecheck: <PASS/FAIL> (<N> errors)
      - build: <PASS/FAIL>

    Code Review:
      - TypeScript strictness: <PASS/FAIL>
      - React patterns: <PASS/FAIL>
      - Accessibility: <PASS/FAIL>
      - Design system: <PASS/FAIL>
      - Architecture: <PASS/FAIL>
      - Data flow: <PASS/FAIL>
      - Performance: <PASS/FAIL>
      - DRYness: <PASS/FAIL>

    Documentation: <PASS/FAIL>

    Electron Testing:
      - App starts: <YES/NO>
      - Screenshot captured: <YES/NO>
      - Feature tested: <YES/NO>
      - Console errors: <NONE / list>
      - Navigation: <ALL PAGES OK / issues>

    Issues Found:
      1. [SEVERITY] file:line — description — fix instruction
      2. ...

    VERDICT: APPROVED / REJECTED
    ```
```

### QA Round Limits

- **Maximum 3 QA rounds** per task
- If a task fails QA 3 times, the coding agent reports the persistent issues to the Team Lead
- The Team Lead may reassign, intervene directly, or escalate to the user

## 7. File & Folder Structure Reference

### Adding a New Feature Module

When a feature is being implemented from scratch:

```
src/renderer/features/<feature-name>/
├── index.ts                    # Barrel exports (public API)
├── api/
│   ├── queryKeys.ts            # React Query cache key factory
│   └── use<Feature>.ts         # Query + mutation hooks
├── components/
│   └── <Feature>Page.tsx       # Main page component
├── hooks/
│   └── use<Feature>Events.ts   # IPC event → query invalidation
└── store.ts                    # Zustand store (UI state only)
```

Corresponding backend:

```
src/main/services/<feature-name>/
└── <feature-name>-service.ts   # Service factory with business logic

src/main/ipc/handlers/
└── <feature-name>-handlers.ts  # IPC handler registration

src/shared/types/
└── <feature-name>.ts           # Domain types (if new)

src/shared/ipc-contract.ts      # Add channels + Zod schemas
```

### Adding a New IPC Channel

Checklist:

1. `src/shared/ipc-contract.ts` — Add channel with input/output Zod schemas
2. `src/main/ipc/handlers/<domain>-handlers.ts` — Add handler that calls service
3. `src/main/ipc/index.ts` — Register handler file (if new file)
4. `src/renderer/features/<name>/api/use<Feature>.ts` — Add React Query hook
5. `src/renderer/features/<name>/hooks/use<Feature>Events.ts` — Add event listener (if event channel)
6. `ai-docs/DATA-FLOW.md` — Document the new channel

### Adding a New Service

Checklist:

1. `src/main/services/<name>/<name>-service.ts` — Factory function with deps
2. `src/main/index.ts` — Instantiate service, pass deps, add to services object
3. `src/main/ipc/handlers/<name>-handlers.ts` — Register IPC handlers
4. `src/main/ipc/index.ts` — Import and register handler file
5. `src/shared/ipc-contract.ts` — Define channels
6. `ai-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Add to service list

## 8. Team Lead Feature Kickoff Checklist

Use this checklist when starting any new feature implementation:

1. READ design doc / plan
2. DECOMPOSE into tasks with dependencies
3. CREATE progress file at `docs/progress/<feature-name>-progress.md`
3b. UPDATE tracker: Add entry to `docs/tracker.json` with status `IN_PROGRESS`
4. CREATE team via TeamCreate
5. CREATE tasks via TaskCreate with proper `blockedBy` relationships
6. CREATE worktrees (if needed)
7. SPAWN agents with full initialization protocol (see section 5)
8. MONITOR progress, update progress file after each state change
9. RUN QA verification for each completed task (see section 6)
10. MERGE worktrees to feature branch
11. RUN full verification suite: `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run build && npm run check:docs`
12. COMMIT and push, create PR if requested
13. UPDATE tracker: Set status to `IMPLEMENTED` in `docs/tracker.json`
14. RUN `npm run validate:tracker` to verify tracker integrity
