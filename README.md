## What is Claude UI?

Claude UI is a desktop application for orchestrating fleets of autonomous Claude coding agents. It provides a unified interface to spawn, monitor, and coordinate AI agents across multiple projects — with workflow-driven task boards, integrated terminals, git workflows, and productivity tools.

**User Story**: *"As a developer managing multiple codebases, I want to delegate tasks to AI agents and track their progress visually, so I can ship features faster while maintaining oversight of what's being built."*

<summary><strong>Architecture Overview</strong></summary>

| Layer | Components | Technology |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Renderer** | React Components, TanStack Router, React Query, Zustand | React 19, TypeScript |
| **Preload Bridge** | Typed IPC Context, window.api | Electron contextBridge |
| **Main Process** | IPC Router, 29 Services, OAuth, MCP Servers, PTY | Node.js, Electron 39 |
| **External** | Hub Server, GitHub/Spotify/Calendar APIs, Anthropic SDK | REST, WebSocket, OAuth2 |
| **Storage** | SQLite (Hub), JSON Files (Local), Task Specs | File system, SQLite |

**Data Flow**: React Query hooks call `ipc()` → Preload bridge → IPC Router → Services → External APIs/Storage

## Workflow-Driven Task Table

The Task Table provides sortable, filterable task management with customizable agent workflows:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph TaskTable["Task Table"]
        Backlog["Backlog"] --> Queue["Queue"]
        Queue --> InProgress["In Progress"]
        InProgress --> AIReview["AI Review"]
        AIReview --> HumanReview["Human Review"]
        HumanReview --> Done["Done"]
    end

    subgraph AgentWorkflow["/implement-feature Workflow"]
        Plan["Phase 1: Plan"] --> Spawn["Phase 2: Spawn Agents"]
        Spawn --> Execute["Phase 3: Execute in Waves"]
        Execute --> Test["Phase 4: Test Gate"]
        Test --> QA["Phase 5: QA Verification"]
        QA --> Merge["Phase 6: Integration"]
    end

    TaskTable -.-> AgentWorkflow
```

**How It Works**:
1. Create a task in the Task Table with requirements and priority
2. Launch `/implement-feature` skill from the task row actions
3. Agents are spawned in waves (Schema → Service → IPC → Components)
4. **Mandatory test suite** runs before any work is claimed complete
5. Progress syncs to `docs/progress/*.md` for crash recovery
6. QA agents verify each component before integration
