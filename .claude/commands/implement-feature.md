# /implement-feature — Team Workflow Orchestrator

> Invoke this skill when you need to implement a feature using Claude Agent Teams with full QA verification, crash-safe progress tracking, and documentation maintenance.

---

## When to Use

- Implementing a new feature from a design document
- Refactoring an existing feature across multiple files
- Any task requiring 3+ specialist agents working in coordination

---

## Phase 1: Load Context

Before anything else, read these files to understand the system:

```
MANDATORY READS:
1. CLAUDE.md                                          — Project rules
2. ai-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md                            — System architecture
3. ai-docs/prompts/implementing-features/README.md    — THE FULL PLAYBOOK
4. ai-docs/prompts/implementing-features/AGENT-SPAWN-TEMPLATES.md  — How to spawn agents
5. ai-docs/prompts/implementing-features/QA-CHECKLIST-TEMPLATE.md  — QA checklist per task
6. ai-docs/prompts/implementing-features/PROGRESS-FILE-TEMPLATE.md — Progress tracking
```

If a design document exists, read it too:
```
docs/plans/<feature-name>.md
```

---

## Phase 2: Check for Existing Progress

Check if this feature was already started by a previous session:

```bash
# Check for existing progress file
ls docs/progress/

# Check for existing worktrees
git worktree list

# Check for existing teams
ls ~/.claude/teams/
```

If a progress file exists for this feature:
1. Read it to understand current state
2. Resume from the first non-COMPLETE task
3. Update the "Last Updated" and "Updated By" fields
4. Skip to the appropriate phase below

---

## Phase 3: Plan & Decompose

1. **Understand the feature** — Read the design doc and all referenced files
2. **Decompose into tasks** — Each task must be:
   - Assignable to exactly ONE specialist agent (from `.claude/agents/`)
   - Scoped to specific files (no two agents editing the same file)
   - Have clear acceptance criteria
   - Have a filled QA checklist (from `QA-CHECKLIST-TEMPLATE.md`)
3. **Map dependencies** — Standard chain:
   ```
   Schema → Service → IPC Handlers → Store + Hooks → Components → Router → Docs
   ```
4. **Identify parallel opportunities** — Tasks with no shared files can run simultaneously

---

## Phase 4: Create Progress File

Create `docs/progress/<feature-name>-progress.md` using the template from `PROGRESS-FILE-TEMPLATE.md`.

This file is your **crash-recovery artifact**. Update it after EVERY state change:
- After creating team and tasks
- After spawning each agent (record worktree branch)
- After each agent completes or fails
- After each QA cycle
- After integration

---

## Phase 5: Set Up Team & Tasks

```
1. TeamCreate — team_name: "<feature-name>"
2. TaskCreate — one per subtask, with description + acceptance criteria
3. TaskUpdate — set addBlockedBy dependencies for each task
4. Update progress file with task list + dependency graph
```

---

## Phase 6: Spawn Agents in Waves

Use the templates from `AGENT-SPAWN-TEMPLATES.md`. Every agent MUST be initialized with:

### Mandatory in every agent prompt:
- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PATTERNS.md`, `LINTING.md`
- Read their `.claude/agents/<role>.md` agent definition
- Read `ai-docs/prompts/implementing-features/README.md`
- Use superpowers skills: `brainstorming`, `writing-plans`, `systematic-debugging`, `verification-before-completion`
- Include the filled QA checklist for their task
- Include instructions to spawn their own QA Review agent when done

### Wave execution:
```
Wave 1: Tasks with no blockers (schema, database)
Wave 2: Tasks unblocked by Wave 1 (services, stores)
Wave 3: Tasks unblocked by Wave 2 (IPC handlers, hooks)
Wave 4: Tasks unblocked by Wave 3 (components, router)
Wave 5: Documentation update (after all QA passes)
```

After each wave completes:
- Update progress file
- Shut down completed agents
- Spawn next wave

---

## Phase 7: QA Verification (Per Task)

Each coding agent is responsible for spawning its own QA Review agent:

```
Coding Agent completes work
  → runs self-review checklist
  → spawns QA Review Agent (same worktree)
    → QA runs: lint, typecheck, build
    → QA reviews: code diff, data flow, error paths, docs
    → QA tests: starts Electron app, uses MCP electron tools
    → QA returns report: PASS or FAIL with issues

If FAIL: coding agent fixes issues, spawns NEW QA agent (max 3 rounds)
If PASS: coding agent sends QA report to Team Lead
```

The Team Lead does NOT run QA — the coding agents handle their own QA cycle.

---

## Phase 8: Integration

When ALL tasks have QA PASS:

1. Merge all worktrees to the feature branch (if using worktrees)
2. Run final verification:
   ```bash
   npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run build
   ```
3. Spawn a documentation update agent (see `AGENT-SPAWN-TEMPLATES.md`)
4. Update progress file status to COMPLETE
5. Update design doc status to IMPLEMENTED
6. Shut down all remaining agents
7. Delete the team (TeamDelete)
8. Commit, push, create PR (if requested by user)

---

## Phase 9: Cleanup

- Update `docs/progress/<feature>-progress.md` → status: COMPLETE
- Update `docs/plans/<design-doc>.md` → status: IMPLEMENTED
- Move design doc to `doc-history/` if requested
- Clean up worktrees: `git worktree remove <path>`
- Report completion summary to user
